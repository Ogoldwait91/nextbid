# NextBid

**Smarter bidding. Better rosters.**

NextBid is a BA-focused JSS bidding assistant for pilots, designed to make roster bidding faster, clearer, and more effective.  
Built by pilots, for pilots.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
Pilots spend hours every month building bids in JSS or using legacy tools like iBidline. These tools donâ€™t provide predictions, explanations, or confidence.  
NextBid changes that:
- **Pre-Process:** Credit range, leave slide, reserve visualisers
- **Build:** Guided Jeppesen-style commands, Waive/Set, Bank Protection toggle
- **Preview:** Top-3 likely rosters, satisfaction scores, quick-fix chips
- **Upload:** Exact JSS export, direct CrewBid submission, receipt capture
- **Insights (opt-in):** Anonymised peer competitiveness colour coding

Our mission: give every pilot confidence in their bid â€" and better work-life balance.
